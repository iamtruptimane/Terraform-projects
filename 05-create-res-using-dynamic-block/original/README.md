This Terraform script is used to provision resources on Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically creating a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and a corresponding security group.
## Provider Configuration
```
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
}

```
Specifies that the provider being used is AWS, and it sets the region to us-west-2 for all the resources provisioned within this Terraform script.

## AWS VPC Resource
```
resource "aws_vpc" "demo-vpc" {
    cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

    tags = {
      Name = "demo-vpc"
    } 
}

```
Defines a VPC named demo-vpc with the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16. Tags the VPC with a "Name" tag for identification.

## AWS Security Group Resource
```
resource "aws_security_group" "web-sg" {
    vpc_id = aws_vpc.demo-vpc.id
    name = "web-sg"
    description = "AWS Security Group for webserver"

    ingress {
        protocol = "tcp"
        from_port = 80
        to_port = 80
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
    
    ingress {
        protocol = "tcp"
        from_port = 443
        to_port = 443
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

    ingress {
        protocol = "tcp"
        from_port = 22
        to_port = 22
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }

    egress {
        protocol = "-1"
        from_port = 0
        to_port = 0
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
}

```
Creates a security group named web-sg for the VPC demo-vpc. This security group includes:

* Ingress Rules: Allow incoming traffic:
    * Port 80 (HTTP)
    * Port 443 (HTTPS)
    * Port 22 (SSH)
    from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

* Egress Rule: Allow all outgoing traffic (-1) from the security group to anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

This script essentially sets up a basic networking environment on AWS, consisting of a VPC and a security group allowing inbound traffic on common web-related ports (HTTP, HTTPS) as well as SSH, and allowing all outbound traffic.
